Quickla is a suite of macros written in Multi-Edit's CMAC C-style macro programming
language. The main features of the suite are:

1. quick access to links, folders, files and applications,
2. list management and
3. miscellaneous utilities.

All the macros run from within Multi-Edit running on Windows 10 and older versions.
