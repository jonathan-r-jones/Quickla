# Workshop: ASP.NET Core

This workshop goes through creating an ASP.NET Core application from scratch, so it is easier to see what all the parts are and what they do. We will use the new, platform-agnostic tools - the .NET Core CLI and VS Code so we can see the cross-platform experience. This can be conducted as a group workshop, or done individually.

# Quickla 

Quickla is a suite of macros written in Multi-Edit's CMAC C-style macro programming
language. The main features of the suite are:

1. quick access to links, folders, files and applications,
2. list management and
3. miscellaneous utilities.

All the macros run from within Multi-Edit running on Windows 10 and older versions.
